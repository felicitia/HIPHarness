## Source Code

All of HipHarnessâ€™s components are implemented in Python, totaling 1,424 SLOC. [[Link]](https://figshare.com/articles/software/HIPHarness_Source_Code/12278891)

## Test Results
The results of each of the 7.3 million prediction models are stored as `HIPHarness-Dataset.RData` file, including the following information. [[Link]](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/HIPHarness_Datasets/12278894)
- the anonymized user ID
- the number of requests sent by the user
- the number and percentage of the repeated requests
- the prediction algorithm used
- the data pruning strategy used
- the statistics of the Test Result (i.e., the output of the Test Engine as shown in Algorithm 1): *cache.size*, the number of requests in the *hit set*, the number of requests in the *miss set*, the number of *prefetched* requests, the number of *hit* requests, the number of *miss* requests
- the accuracy results: static precision, static recall, dynamic recall
- the runtime of training the prediction model and evaluating the model

## Data Analysis R Script
All the data analyses are performed through R scripts based on the Test Results stored in `HIPHarness-Dataset.RData`, totaling 1,036 SLOC. [[Link]](https://figshare.com/articles/software/HiPHarness_R_Scripts/12278903)
